DDLA: Dual Deep Learning Architecture for Plant Species Recognition
DDLA proposes and combines two deep learning models, namely, MobileNet and DenseNet-121 for extracting leaf features. For classification of plant species, multinomial logistic regression.
The reference paper and two main python files used are uploaded in this project.
